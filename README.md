# GSOC 2021 Report - Sugar Labs

### About the project:

My project involves creating a Measure Activity for Sugarizer which can run on all the platforms.

### Measure Activity:

The Measure Activity is a tool that allows kids to indulge in "learning by doing". It provides an interface for the kids to connect with the physical world and an opportunity to view and understand through a visual and statistical representation of the physical phenomena. Through this activity, children will learn concepts related to sound.

### PR link: https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/pull/957

### Activity Status:

The activity is in its final stages of testing and will be merged soon to the dev branch. It will then be included in the subsequent release.

### Activity UI:

### Features:

* **Share/Multiplayer:** Activity can be shared among multiple users and changes done by one user will be reflected in otherâ€™s activity also.
* **Time and Frequency:** User can switch between time and frequency mode. In time mode, x-axis will contain time and in frequency mode, x-axis will contain frequency. Y-axis will contain amplitude of microphone data.
